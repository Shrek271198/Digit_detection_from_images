# Machine-Perception
Program to read and detect numbers on an image.

# 1) Description of Project
This project aims to use the library called OpenCV (open Computer Vision) in Python to locate numbers and then predict the number from an image an write it to an output file.

# 2) Getting started
To run the code in Python, first we need to get the environment. 

## NOTE:

- If you are using Linux, just open a directory and run the following commands. 
- If you using Windows, get the Linux Terminal from Microsoft Store (search up on Google if you don't know how to get around this).

## Follow the steps to get started:

#### i) Git clone the repository and extract the "train.zip" folder

#### ii) Install Virtual Environment
```shell
$ pip3 install virtualenv
```

#### iii) Activate the Virtual Environment
```shell
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

#### iv) Install the required packages
```shell
$ pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```

#### v) This step is for Windows users only (For Linux users, skip this step)
> When the Python file is run, it will display images. To view them, a software called Xming needs to be downloaded. 

##### a) To download Xming, follow this link and click download:
